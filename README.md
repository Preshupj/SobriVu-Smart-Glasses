# SobriVu Smart Glasses: Addressing Problematic Drinking Among College Students

**Problem Statement**
Problematic drinking among college students remains a significant health issue in the United States, with high rates of alcohol consumption leading to various adverse outcomes, including injuries, assaults, and academic difficulties.

**Proposed Solution: SobriVu Smart Glasses**
SobriVu smart glasses are an innovative wearable technology designed to address problematic drinking among college students. 

**_Key features include:_**
Alcohol intake tracking
Interactive motivational interviewing (MI) through text-based messages
Visual exposure to social media images normalizing sobriety

**Theoretical Framework**
The solution is based on the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), which posits that attitudes and social norms influence behavioral intention, which in turn predicts behavior.

**Key Technologies and Techniques**
Smart glasses with camera, microphone, and speaker
Object recognition for alcohol consumption tracking
Voice recognition for user responses
Motivational Interviewing (MI) techniques
Social media integration for normalizing sobriety

**Evaluation Plan**
Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)
Primary outcome: Decrease in AUDIT-C score
Secondary outcomes: Decrease in binge drinking days, alcohol-related injuries, and average drinks per day
Data collection at baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months

**Scientific Significance**
Integration of MI techniques with wearable technology
Real-time, personalized interventions
Reshaping social norms around alcohol consumption
Addressing "text neck" issue with eye-level information display

**Societal Impact**
Potential reduction in alcohol-related damage among college students
Improvement in academic performance and overall well-being
Influence on social norms surrounding drinking and sobriety

**Limitations and Ethical Considerations**
Privacy and consent concerns
Potential for stigmatization
Generalizability of findings
Possible rebel effect due to technology tracking
